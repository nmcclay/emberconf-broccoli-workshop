Please ensure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

```bash
yarn global add broccoli-cli
```

It is also recommended that you install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as this repo has support for
interactive debugging, but don't worry, it's not mandatory, feel free to use whatever editor you're comfortable with.
If you intend to use debugging, you should also have Node version 8 or above.

That's it for now, looking forward to meeting everyone! üêπ
