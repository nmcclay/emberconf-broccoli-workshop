# EmberConf 2018 Broccoli Workshop

2 steps to get setup for the Broccoli.js workshop:

Please ensure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

```bash
yarn global add broccoli-cli
```

Clone this repo and run `yarn` before the workshop, or if you want the goods individually:

```bash
yarn add babel-core \
    babel-plugin-external-helpers \
    babel-preset-env \
    broccoli \
    broccoli-asset-rev \
    broccoli-asset-rewrite \
    broccoli-babel-transpiler \
    broccoli-clean-css \
    broccoli-config-replace \
    broccoli-env \
    broccoli-funnel \
    broccoli-livereload \
    broccoli-merge-trees \
    broccoli-rollup \
    broccoli-sass-source-maps \
    broccoli-stew \
    broccoli-typescript-compiler \
    broccoli-uglify-sourcemap \
    rollup-plugin-babel \
    rollup-plugin-commonjs \
    rollup-plugin-node-resolve \
    rollup-plugin-uglify \
    @glimmer/app-compiler
```

It is also recommended that you install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as this repo has support for
interactive debugging, but don't worry, it's not mandatory, feel free to use whatever editor you're comfortable with.

That's it for now, looking forward to meeting everyone! üêπ
